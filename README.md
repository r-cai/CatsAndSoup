# CatsAndSoup
5/18
repo created.

5/24 (prototype handed in, coding begins)
files created.
draw main tab
Ingredients extends Soup
Map
Soup
Station
SoupStation extends Station
tentative instance variables initialized. Station no longer extends Map due to recursive error when Map makes a new soupstation

5/25 
drawshop written, drawlot written, drawtable written. drawlot and drawtable currently only draw empty lot/table. added example timers from Mr. K's demo

5/26
still developing graphical features. position of station to be initialized in x,y depending on which lot. successfully merged drawStation into drawLot. finished graphical design of cats. 

5/27
More development of timers. working on a feature that shows the progress of the timer when mouse hovers over it. working on showProg for each station. 

5/30
fixed timers on stations & soupstation. currently using second() instead of countdown. soup successfully added when soupstation timer is up. graphical additions to 'Carrot' and 'Cabbage' stations. 
BUGS
Ingredients not added when station timer is up.

5/31
pause button now suspends timers. clicking on soup removes soup and adds gold. ingredients are still not being added to the soup. shop adds stations to map. 
commit history deleted because of pull/push issue. I recloned the repo in order to resolve. 
PRIORITY
work on getting ingredient into soup

6/1 
remove button added, still buggy

6/2
remove button works. cost of adding soupstation scales up when there are 4 stations in lot. 

6/3
added corn type station, scaled currency.

6/6
added map expansions, with buy screen. arrow keys to scroll betweeen maps.

6/7
added decorations class, variables, etc. but still buggy and does not add to the map properly

6/8
decorations class added properly, but the hover function is not working. (the decoration should hover as the mouse moves to place, and only places down when clicked)

6/9 
added decoration pngs, and the hover function is now working. 

6/10
added pngs to all elements (station,cat,map etc.) instead of processing generated shapes.
